Animal Crossing New Horizons has a lot of critters and villagers and it gets hard to track your progress in the game as well 
as plan out your activities if you don't know what's going to happen. With the Animal Crossing New Horizons Buddy, we want to 
make tracking your critters and villagers easier for you. By showing you what critters are catchable at the current time, you
can find out when specific critters come out or when to celebrate the villagers' birthdays. That way, you can make the most 
out of your day.
