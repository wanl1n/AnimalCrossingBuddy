Bah, I say! BAH! They may have brightly colored wings, but the way they flutter and flitter...SO FOUL! In fact, the agrias butterfly flies so fast, it is quite a feat to catch one. I suppose I should congratulate you on your good fortune... But catching any bug seems a misfortune to me."

You see, the ant itself is the strongest creature in the world in relation to its size. One of these diminutive fiends can carry 50 times its own bodyweight! And if it wants to lift something even larger... Why, it simply calls on its ant friends to join the effort. Creepy cooperation, I say..."

Not only is it one of the largest moths in the world... The tips of its wings look rather like the heads of venomous snakes! Despite its largeness and loathsome looks, the adult Atlas moth lives only for a few days. It emerges from its cocoon without a mouth, you see...and so cannot eat.

The filthy fraud uses silk and leaves to spin a cozy bag for it to hide inside—hence the name. Some find it cute the way bagworms dangle from trees. But the truth is they're gluttonous monsters. These beasts love to stuff their bug- gullets full of leaves, devouring the very trees they hang upon. Wretched villains is what they are."

And I concede it is a rather pleasant sound. What I do NOT find pleasant is the way these things rub their strange wings together to make their song! Ick and blech! And to make matters worse, bell crickets have been known to shed two of their four wings! And they simply leave these wings where they fall, as if it were litter! I simply cannot abide such odious behavior."

The ravenous beasts chew through cabbage, broccoli, kale and the like with a devastating gusto. And my feathers! Their green coloring is truly GROSS! A hoo-rrific hue, I say."

Well, to begin with, they are mostly nocturnal creatures. And for that you day-loving diurnal types should be grateful! Hoo! It means you don't have to lay eyes upon their prickly legs or overly long antennae like us night owls! Of course, crickets are best known for the chirping sound they make by rubbing their wings together. Some find the noise lovely to listen to. Alas, it only serves to remind me of another unpleasant fact... Which is to say...you will find a cricket's ears right next to its knees! I've gone weak in the knees at the mention of it!"

But don't let the delicate looks fool you! Much like the dragonfly, the damselfly is a ruthless predator. It loves to catch flies midair and eat them, and has been known to snack on spiders it plucks from the web! In short, it is not a dinner guest I would recommend...

Its impressive bird-like wingspan and elusive nature have made it a favorite among butterfly aficionados. But truth be told, the so-called great purple emperor has some not-so-great personal peculiarities. For one...it has two horrid HORNS upon its head when it is in its caterpillar form. For two...it has been known to dine on feces and animal carcasses! Hoo! That's why I call it the Emperor of EWWW!"

As such, the hermit crab has 10 legs and also wears a shell. But it doesn't grow this shell itself. It slips its soft body into shells left behind by snails, you see, and moves into ever-larger ones as it grows. Talk about a strange way to make a home."

I have terrified myself just talking about it."
