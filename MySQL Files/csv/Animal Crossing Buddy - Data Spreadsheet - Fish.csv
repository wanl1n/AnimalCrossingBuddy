Just look at the elegance of those fins! Despite the name, however, these lovelies are known to be rather aggressive. They've no qualms about relentlessly pursuing fish much smaller than themselves! Why, they even attack their own kin! It seems no fish is safe around these ""angelic"" bullies. It makes one wonder who comes up with these names. Appearances— and names— can be deceiving."

Indeed, it is among the largest freshwater fish there are. Furthermore, these fascinating fish make quite the family unit. That is to say, male arapaimas protect their young by holding them gently in their mouths. Meanwhile, female arapaimas swim circles around these full-mouthed fathers fending off predators. It simply goes to show that cold-blooded creatures can be heartwarming too."

This beauteous arowana fetches a pretty Bell, though I'd venture to say that its true price is beyond measure. The arowana is an excellent jumper.

It's up to us to do all we can to help preserve such magnificent creatures for the years to come."

I would love nothing more! The barred knifejaw, also called the striped beakfish, is a lovely fish with a distinctive striped pattern. It is reportedly also a very curious fish in that it has been known to approach swimmers to ""greet"" them. They also tend to be good at avoiding fishing hooks, so well done on outwitting this one!"

At first blush, a transparent head seems absurd, but there is a reason: so it can see things directly above! But I must confess - the more I learn about deep-sea fish, the happier I am to live on dry land, wot."

The bitterling isn't being sneaky. No, their young help keep the bivalve healthy by eating invading parasites! It's a wonderful bit of evolutionary deal making, don't you think? Each one keeping the other safe... Though eating parasites does not sound like a happy childhood... Is that why the fish is so bitter?"

In some areas, there are even those who professionally catch just black bass! Yet in other areas where they are NOT native, they are considered an ecological nuisance. Invasive, even.

What you may not have known is that poison and spines are not the limit of this animal's defenses! A predator that tries to swallow a blowfish before it inflates can find itself quickly choking. To be honest, if said predator can get past poison, spines, AND choking hazards, I feel they've earned a meal."

It is an unusual relative of the tuna. These mighty fish can exceed 13 feet from bill to tail. Some accounts even have it fighting with whales! No wonder it's a popular target for sport fishing: unlike most fish, it seems like a worthy opponent."

A bit too common, depending upon where you are. They eat anything that fits in their mouths and are highly adaptable. The bane of fishermen in some areas, bluegill is often the only fish to be caught! But looking in its wee beady eyes, I must say I see no ill will in it..."

I refer to it as a butterfly fish, but it's actually a grouping in which there are over 100 types!

They are territorial predators, and therefore must constantly defend their 'turf' from others. So when you see a large char like this one, it is likely a skilled fighter and veteran of many battles. My feathers! I hope it never has cause to go into battle with me!"

These vibrant fishes make their home among venomous anemones. It's a mutually beneficial arrangement. The clown fish finds safety in the anemone's wriggling arms, as well as leftover scraps of food. In return, clown fish ward off parasites and predators for the anemone. Thus these colorful fish remind us of the importance of maintaining good cheer among our roommates."

And just what is a barbel, you ask? Well, a barbel looks a little something like a mustache. A run-of-the-mill carp will sport this unsightly ""facial hair,"" while a crucian carp is considerably better groomed! I tried to grow a mustache when I was younger. It never did fill in quite right... All for the best in the end, as mustaches go so much better with noses than with beaks!"

Personally, I am morbidly fascinated by each fish's eye placement. The dab's eyes are both on its right side, while the olive flounder's are on the left. These fish spend lots of time lying on their sides in the sand, so the odd eye placement makes some sense... But its-how can I put this? Creepy? Viscerally disturbing? Profoundly upsetting to fans of symmetry?"

In addition to its powerful bite, this little critter has the ability to breathe both above and below water! It has an unusually long neck which it uses for both breathing and biting. Come to think of it, how did you manage to avoid being bitten? Well, it's a fearsome critter, but just look at that face! Rather silly, wot?"

Many mollusks like snails and clams have shells, but the squid's body is almost completely soft. The exception is a long, narrow bit of hard material going through its main body - the last remnant of its shell. Of course, having your shell INSIDE is not a best practice. Perhaps they lost the owner's manual!"

Consequently, while it takes a while, they can get quite large-perhaps even up to six feet long! The stringfish is perhaps the best embodiment in the fish world of 'slow and steady wins the race'"

One curious behavior of theirs is leaping high out of the water and falling back in on their sides. The smacking sounds of their re-entry can be heard for up to half a mile away, likely more underwater! No one knows why they do it, but I like to think it's their impression of bread popping out of a toaster!"

The benefit to the suckerfish is that it gets to eat smaller parasites and dead skin off the host's body. Amusingly, some people have used suckerfish on cords to catch large turtles with the fish's own suction! I imagine this practice is the cause of some awkward conversations between fish and turtle, eh wot"

Careful, now! These fish are particularly dangerous, despite their seemingly docile appearance. With its saturated blue and yellow tones, the surgeonfish is quite breathtaking. It's got to keep up with all the other vibrant fish that live in the coral too, I wager. Quite the competition! Its spine is sharp as a blade, so care must be taken when handling these beauties..."

These slippery fellows appear in numbers when it warms up. They hatch in a river, then swim to the ocean. Once mature, they return to the river where they were born. But when they return depends on the river temperature— if it's too cold their fishing season will start later. Some even say summer can't start without sweetfish despite the KEY role played by the earth's axial tilt!"

It is a highly adaptable river fish. They mainly feed on algae, but they will also eat larvae and dead fish— or whatever fits in their mouths. I will confess that, as a growing owlet, I similarly defined food as 'anything that fits in my beak.'"

But sleep should be restful, eh wot! If I were the tuna I would feel very hard done by!"

Unlike many of their kin in the shark family, whale sharks are nonviolent, eating only plankton and such. They grow slowly and live long, relaxed lives of filter feeding and leisure in warm waters. So if you ever have to choose a fish as a roommate, you could do worse than the whale shark. Unless you can't swim."

This zebra turkeyfish is as stunning to gaze upon as it is deadly. Those spines that are part of its defining physique are chock-full of venom. Fortunately, zebra turkeyfish are not susceptible to another's venom. Though solitary, I imagine they give one another a mean fin bump when passing each other by."
